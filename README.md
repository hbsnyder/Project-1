# Project-1
We worked with a large data set to determine if there was any major factor that 
showed a correlation to winning. 

Questions: Who has the most wins?
           Who has the most losses?
           Does stadium size affect wins and losses?
           Does the age of a franchise affect winning?
           If you shoot more free throws, do you win more often?
           If you commit more fouls, do you win more often?
           
           
Conclusion:   The questions that we went through all came to 
the same conclusion.  Winning and a singular statistic are not correlated.  We 
believe that multiple variables would be needed to show a correlation in wins.
