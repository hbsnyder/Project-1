# Project-1

We worked with a seasons worth of NBA data to determine if there was any major statictis that were correlating to winning in the NBA. We were able to extract the data, clean it and load it to come up with our conclusions.

The questions we asked were: 

Who has the most wins? 
Who has the most losses? 

Does stadium size affect wins and losses? 
Does the age of a franchise affect winning? 

If you shoot more free throws, do you win more often? 
If you commit more fouls, do you win more often?

Conclusion: 
The questions that we went through all came to the same conclusion. Winning and a singular statistic are not correlated. We believe that multiple variables would be needed to show a correlation in wins.  Additionally, the data set we used was not large enough.  We believe that if we were to have larger sets of data and kept years to ranges that were era specific, wininning would have a better chance to be defined statictly.
